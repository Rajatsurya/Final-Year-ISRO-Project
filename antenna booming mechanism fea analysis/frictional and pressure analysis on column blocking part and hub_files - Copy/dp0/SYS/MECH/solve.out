 Symmetric Deformable- deformable contact pair identified by real        
 constant set 9 and contact element type 8 has been set up.  The         
 companion pair has real constant set ID 8.  Both pairs should have the  
 same behavior.                                                          
 ANSYS will keep the current pair and deactivate its companion pair,     
 resulting in asymmetric contact.                                        
 Linear contact is defined
